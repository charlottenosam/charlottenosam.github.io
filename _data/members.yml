  description: My work focuses on understanding "Cosmic Dawn" -- when and how did the first galaxies form, what are their connections with the dark matter halos they form in, and how was intergalactic hydrogen reionized? Outside of work I try to spend as much of my time as possible away from a computer, usually in or on water (mostly swimming and rowing).

  description: I joined DAWN as a master’s student exploring how we can infer measures of the escape fraction of ionising photons from galaxies. I recently started as a PhD student in the group, where I will use JWST data to investigate how we can better measure the high redshift galaxy population and explore different hypotheses for why star-formation may be different in the early Universe. Outside of work I enjoy reading and drawing - and when the Danish weather allows it, you can find me playing football.

  description: I joined DAWN as a postdoc after getting my PhD at the University of Florence, under the supervision of Stefania Salvadori. My research focuses on studying the first galaxies in our Universe, investigating how they formed their stars and how they evolved. Beyond astrophysics, I’m passionate about music and exploring the world on my bike.

  description: My work focuses on understanding the Epoch of Reionisation with theoretical models and simulations - what was the nature of the first galaxies emerging in our Universe, and how did they evolve? What were their footprints in the ionisation state of the intergalactic hydrogen gas?

She is now a DAWN Fellow co-supervising Gonzalo, and is interested in understanding the properties of early galaxies. Outside of work, she enjoys many forms of movement, including biking, climbing, and running.
