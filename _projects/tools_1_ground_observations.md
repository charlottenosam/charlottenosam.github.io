I am involved with observations from our largest telescopes in space and on the ground.

I am a member of the [Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG) Survey](http://borg.astro.ucla.edu/) which searches for bright galaxy candidates at z > 8 in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, and the [Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space (GLASS)](http://glass.astro.ucla.edu/), a HST spectroscopic survey of high-redshift galaxies lensed by clusters. We followed up GLASS targets in the [KLASS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019Msngr.176...33F/abstract) survey with VLT/KMOS and at [Keck](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...878...12H/abstract).

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is expanding our frontier to the earliest galaxies. I'm part of the JWST Early Release Science program GLASS which surveyed the Frontier Fields galaxy cluster Abell 2744 -- [learn more here](http://glass.astro.ucla.edu/ers/). In Cycle 2 I am co-leading two programs -- to [test the existence](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=4287) of one of the first reionized bubbles in the universe, and to provide an 'unbiased' view of the high-redshift universe with the NIRCam pure-parallel survey [BEACON](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=3990).
