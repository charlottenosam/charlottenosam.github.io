The universe underwent a phase transition from predominantly neutral at recombination (z ∼ 1100), to almost fully ionized by z ∼ 6. We have not identified the sources of ionizing photons – though the most likely candidates are young stars in galaxies.

Lyman alpha emission from star-forming galaxies is absorbed by neutral gas, so observations of Lyα in high-z galaxies can constrain the timeline and morpology of reionization. I have developed a [new Bayesian framework](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...856....2M) for directly inferring the neutral hydrogen fraction in the IGM from Lyα observations. I led the design, reduction and analysis of a ESO VLT Large Program with [KMOS](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/develop/instruments/kmos.html) (PI: A Fontana) to [measure the reionization timeline](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.485.3947M/abstract) from upper limits of Lyα emission at z > 7.5.
