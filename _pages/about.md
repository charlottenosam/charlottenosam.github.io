I work at the intersection of theory and observations in astrophysics. Most of my work has focused on understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies in the early universe, including those formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, their connections to the dark matter halos they form in, and their relationship to the reionization of intergalactic hydrogen in the universe's first billion years. I typically combine empirical and semi-analytical theoretical modelling with statistical analyses of observations to ask what our frontier observations of galaxies tell us about the early universe. For more details see my [research page](/research), my [CV](/assets/pdf/CV-CharlotteMason.pdf), and [my papers on ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=NOT&filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=*%3A*&filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=author_facet_hier%3A%221%2FMason%2C%20C%2FMason%2C%20Christopher%20E%22&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_bibstem_facet%7D&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_author%7D&fq_author=(*%3A*%20NOT%20author_facet_hier%3A%221%2FMason%2C%20C%2FMason%2C%20Christopher%20E%22)&fq_bibstem_facet=(((((*%3A*%20NOT%20bibstem_facet%3A%22E%26PSL%22%20NOT%20bibstem_facet%3A%22LPICo%22%20NOT%20bibstem_facet%3A%22ESASP%22)%20NOT%20bibstem_facet%3A%22cosp%22%20NOT%20bibstem_facet%3A%22LPI%22)%20NOT%20bibstem_facet%3A%22JDSO%22)%20NOT%20bibstem_facet%3A%22NewSp%22)%20NOT%20bibstem_facet%3A%22IJAsB%22%20NOT%20bibstem_facet%3A%22IMAFu%22)&fq_database=((database%3A%22astronomy%22)%20NOT%20database%3A%22earthscience%22)&p_=0&q=author%3A%22mason%2C%20c%22%20year%3A2011-2099&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc){:target="\_blank"}.
